# Project Title

This project aims at building a tool that allows anyone to find their ideal residence place in a given city by specifying their personal level of importance for the location's visual appeal and environmental parameters.
This repository mainly contains the steps followed to build a model able to evaluate a picture's appeal by means of image analysis. An interactive map is also available to see the application on a city, with different layers for environmental parameters.
